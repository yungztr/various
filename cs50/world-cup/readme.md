# World-Cup Predictions

to run the code type

```terminal
python tournament.py filename
```

the `filename` can be either **2018m.csv** or **2019w.csv**
you can outcomment the terminal-input check and hard code the file location too

The file **answers.txt** also includes the time measurements

### little disclaimer

I have tested this code inside github codespaces too and it worked fine (there was an error on __counting wrong__ im not sure why)
I have made an adjustment to the csv files and removed the heading on top (`teams, rating`)
The program currently only works that way but it really is a easy job to fix it the right way too (I was too lazy)
    Any small help as a pull request would be appreciated
