## problem

if you have ever visited a canyon or a cave, you may have yelled and heard the echo of your own voice. in this problem, you should simulate that effect:

> hello! hello! hello!

your program will be given as input a single word, and it should print out that word three times, separating the words with spaces.
as a refresher, here are some ways to read a single word from standard input (when the first line of input contains a single word), in a few different languages:

the first step in programming her safe in this manner is to write a program to swap the digits of a 2-digit code.

### input

input is a single line, containing exactly one word. the only characters used are upper and/or lowercase letters (aâ€“z). the word contains at least one and at most 15 characters.

### output

output the given word three times, separated by spaces.

### examples

_input_
```text
hello
```
_output_
`hello hello hello`

---
_input_
```text
echo
```
_output_
`echo echo echo`
