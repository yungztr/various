# stock_visualization

visualizes stocks in a VERY simple way by requesting data from alphavantage API
& then running it on locla browser through streamlit

note that API calls are limited by rate (alphavantage 25 per day)
always have a local data.json as a backup, you can then just locally load the file
(you probably wont lol made this just for testing python)

i did not implement any try except methods or sum like that
